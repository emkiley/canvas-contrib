Add a Carousel to Catalog Login Page
====================================

This branding will help you add some options to your Catalog page.

You will only want to edit the variables for the text if you decide you want to have text.

You will need to host this behind a secure server (HTTPS) that Catalog can access. 

You will need to download the icons folder with all the images, or you will not see icons for the buttons to move left or right in the carousel.
